This project aims to explore the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting the outcomes of government tenders using a time series approach. The study focuses on analyzing historical data of tenders issued by the government over a specific period to identify patterns and trends that may be used to make informed predictions about future tender outcomes. The time series aspect of the project will allow for the consideration of cyclical and seasonal effects that may influence the tender outcomes. Several machine learning models, including ARIMA, LSTM, and SARIMA, will be tested and compared to determine their effectiveness in accurately predicting the outcomes of government tenders. These models have been selected based on their ability to handle time-series data, which is a critical aspect of predicting government tender outcomes. The results of this project will provide valuable insights into the use of machine learning in enhancing decision-making processes in government procurement. Accurate predictions can help governments make informed decisions about the allocation of resources, reducing waste and increasing efficiency.
